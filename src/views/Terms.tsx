            When prompted during the purchase process, we may, at our discretion, allow you to select AT3 Token as a payment method for the purchase of eligible products and services in certain jurisdictions, as detailed in our AT3 Token Payments FAQ at www.atomic3.io/support/token-at3, which we may update from time to time. We may require you to provide us with additional information to verify your identity when selecting the AT3 token as your payment method. To make a payment in AT3 token, you need a digital wallet that supports AT3 token transfers to external digital wallets, compatible hardware, and internet access. <br />

            If you decide to make an eligible purchase with AT3 token, you must select AT3 token as your payment method when prompted. We will provide you with a digital wallet address ("AT3 Token Address") in alphanumeric form and in QR code. This is the payment location where you will need to send the AT3 token from your digital wallet. You can copy and paste or manually enter the alphanumeric code we provide you into the recipient field in your digital wallet software, or if your digital wallet software supports QR codes, scan the QR code we provide using your device to auto-fill the recipient field with the alphanumeric code.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold text-celeste">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span> It is your responsibility to confirm and verify that the alphanumeric code provided is identical to the alphanumeric code displayed in your digital wallet software by scanning the QR code or copying and pasting the alphanumeric code. We will not be responsible for any loss of AT3 token or other digital assets as a result of sending AT3 token to an incorrect wallet address or sending a digital asset other than AT3 token.

            You are responsible for paying directly all network fees associated with the transaction (“Transaction Fees”), in addition to the AT3 Token Price. If your digital wallet software does not automatically generate an amount for Transaction Fees, you will need to calculate the amount necessary for the transaction to be processed on the AT3 token network. For more details on Transaction Fees, please see the AT3 Token FAQ at www.atomic3.io/support/token-at3. The Transaction Fee covers the cost of verifying AT3 token transactions. We have no control over the Transaction Fee and do not receive any part of it.

            Once an AT3 token transaction is sent to the network, it will be unconfirmed for a period of time (generally less than an hour, but up to a day or more) until the network reflects such transfer in a specified number of consecutive blocks in the AT3 token network. Such number will be determined by us at our discretion. We will consider your transaction pending until the AT3 token network reflects the transaction in the required number of consecutive blocks. We will send you an email communication once we have received your payment.
